Before running the program ensure images are saved in a folder named base name.
e.g if running tests for base name SCAN, save all the images and the header in
a folder called SCAN.

To run program, type the following into the terminal:

1. make depend 
2. make main 

*These need to be run once only.

The program can be run using the following command:
volimage <imageBase> [-d i j output_file_name] [-x i output_file_name] [-g i]

*Only one optional argument may be used at each run of the application.
*-g option has been implemented.
